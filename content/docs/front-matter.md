description = "Configure the front matter for your documentation pages, including fields like page title, description, layout, and collections."

[[collection]]

The front matter uses [TOML syntax](https://toml.io/) and is surrounded by +++ delimiters like this:

```toml
+++
title = "My Page"
layout = "DefaultLayout"
+++
```

Three fields are required in the front matter:

- `title` - The title of the page, which will be displayed in the browser tab and as the main heading on the page
- `description` - A description of the page. You can then use it, for example, as the description in the meta tags
- `layout` - The layout to use for the page

Optionally, you can define:

- `id` - An identifier for the page, which can be used for internal linking (for example, add id = "example-page" to the front matter and link to this page using: {context.link_to("#example-page")})
- `last_updated_at` - A UTC timestamp indicating when the page was last updated
- `primary_collection` - Used to indicate the primary collection for the page when it belongs to multiple collections
- `props` - A table of additional properties that can be used in the layout
- `render` - If set to false, the page will not be rendered (which can be used for index pages)

You can also optionally define the `[[collection]]` section in the front matter to include the page in a collection and use it to define the navigation structure. In the example below, the page is included in the `docs` collection, placed after the `what-is-poet` page, and under the `docs/index` parent page:

```toml
[[collection]]
after = "docs/what-is-poet"
name = "docs"
parent = "docs/index"
```
